# Description

An Ed-Tech project to develop a data-driven dashboard and mobile app to help urban communities in India track, manage, and reduce household waste. Users input their daily waste data (segregation, recycling, composting), and the app provides visual insights, waste reduction tips, and progress reports. Leverage local municipal data to highlight the communityâ€™s collective impact. Gamify the experience with badges, competitions between neighborhoods, and rewards for sustainable practices. Include integration with local recyclers or waste-pickup services for seamless adoption.
